            <h3>Frequently asked questions</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>I made a top up and it is not showing up?</strong>
                    <br>Top ups are usually processed within 30 minutes, but the myki system could take longer to apply an online top up. Please check again in 24 hours.
                    <br>
                    <br>If the top up is still not processed in 24 hours, please contact PTV or myki. The app does not see your account or credit card details so I am unable to help you with any transaction enquiries.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Is this an official myki app?</strong>
                    <br>No.
                </li>
                <li id="iosapp">
                    <strong>Why isn't the iOS app available?</strong>
                    <br>Unfortunately Apple has repeatedly rejected the app for the App Store, based on grounds that it is not published by myki. Alternatively you can <a href="https://testflight.apple.com/join/Jj3B6vQ8">download the beta from TestFlight</a>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Does this app top up faster than the myki website?</strong>
                    <br>No. This app uses the same top up functionality as the myki website.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>I can't seem to log in with the correct username & password?</strong>
                    <br>A number of people have reported this issue. It appears the myki system has a bug with older accounts with longer passwords or non-alphanumeric symbols. (Sometime recently a password length restriction was added.) Users have been able to workaround this issue by changing their account
                    password to something shorter and only alphanumeric characters.
                </li>
                <li id="international">
                    <strong>I topped up with an international credit card, money has been deducted from my credit card but my myki is not topped up?</strong>
                    <br>Unfortunately myki appears to be blocking top ups online using international credit cards. Your top up will not be processed. You have to top up using a myki machine, store or at a ticket counter.
                    <br>
                    <br>Fortunately the money deducted from your credit card is only a temporary transaction and is usually automatically refunded within a few business days. Since the app does not see your account or credit card details, I am unable to help you with any transaction enquiries. Please contact your bank or myki for more information.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Why is my balance or transactions inaccurate?</strong>
                    <br>The app uses the data provided by the myki website which is usually delayed by 12 hours, up to 24 hours.
                    <br>
                    <br>The myki website is known to have issues with some transaction records such as missing cost details for some touch-offs, this may cause the app to inaccurately show myki pass transactions.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>What are the weird names in my touch-on and touch-off history?</strong>
                    <br>The myki has poor formatting for bus and tram stops. Unfortunately I'm too lazy to correct them.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Can this app send me push notifications when my balance is low or pass is about to expire?</strong>
                    <br>Unfortunately the app does not send push notifications because it would have required storing your myki account login information on a server, and I don't want to do that.
                    <br>
                    <br>You can add a calendar reminder for when your pass expires by tapping on the alarm button.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Are you stealing my myki information?</strong>
                    <br>Myki information is only sent to the myki website and stored on the device for automatic log-in. No myki information is sent or stored on any other servers.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Are you stealing my credit card information?</strong>
                    <br> Credit card information is only sent to the myki website and is only stored on the device if you wish to save your credit card details for convenience.
                    <br>
                    <br>If you are tech savvy, you can audit the network traffic with a proxy or <a href="https://github.com/longzheng/mypal-ionic/">audit the source code here</a>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Who made this and why?</strong>
                    <br>My name is <a href="https://twitter.com/longzheng">Long Zheng</a> and I'm a software designer &amp; developer in Melbourne.
                    <br>
                    <br>I use myki everyday but the myki website is extremely cumbersome, especially on mobile. I was eager to learn the new mobile development tool Ionic2 and I thought it might be useful to make a better experience for myki on mobile.
                    <br>
                    <br>I want to make myki great again.
